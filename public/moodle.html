            <div class = "col-sm-6">
               <h4 id="ptxt">Phishing attack</h4>

               <p class="well">Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails posing as a company to entice a target to give up information.Highlighed
               in (fig2.1) the are things to look out for. <br>This phishing email is pretending to be someone who wants their tax returns done and accidentally sent it to you.<br>
                Highlighted in <font style="color:red"> red</font> is the email address.Question does this email address make sense.Usually a persons name will somewhat match their email address.<br>
                Highlighted in <font style="color:blue"> blue</font> is the attachment.Inside of this attachment is an embedded piece of malware. Attachments should never be opened from someone you do not know or do not trust.<br>
              Highlighted in <font style="color:orange"> yellow</font> is the start of the email, If this was a legitmate email meant for you it would like start "hi YourName" not just "Hi". Phishing emails tend to start off with the generic
            impersonal touch as they dont alway know the name of the target.<br>Another thing to note when working with emails is to never click on links. Google the web page your are meant to be going to instead.</p>

            <div class = "col-sm-6">
               <h4 id="ptxt">Web attacks</h4>

               a site that automatically downloads malicious file for you to click on.<br>
                In (fig 3.1) There some highlighted things to look out for.<br>
                  Highlighted in <font style="color:red"> red</font> is the URL , is this the right webpage you visited. It could be only something small like a character missing or an extra one put in or
                  even a letter from a different alphabet that looks similar like in <code>go√≥gle.com</code> the second 'o' is from a different alphabet.<br>
                    Highlighted in <font style="color:blue"> blue</font> is a lock with a line through it meaning it is uncertified and potentially unsecure. if this lock is green or hasn't got a line through it then it means that you are on a trust certified webpage.
                    Always check to see if there is a green lock when visiting a webpage and be extra cautious if you are on a webpage that is unsecure.<br>
                      Highlighted in <font style="color:orange"> orange</font> is a warning from the browser leting you know that the webpage is not secure.If a warning like this appears it is best not to enter in any details.

               <h4 id="ptxt">Removable Devices Attacks</h4>

               <p class="well">Removable devices such as USBs are dangerous tools that are deployed by attackers.An attacker can leave a devices like a USB lying around hoping for someone to pick it
                 up and plug it into their computer. These removable devices can have malware inside of them that runs as soon as you plug the device into your computer. Another method they deploy is embedding malware into a
                 file that entices the victims curiousity making them want to click onto the file ,but when this file is clicked malware runs. Removeable devices from unknown sources should never be picked up and inserted into
                 ones computer.
